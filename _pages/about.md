Hi! I'm a Mathematics and Physics student at the University of Manchester, focusing on Probability and Statistics and Theoretical Quantum Mechanics. I'm also an undergraduate research assistant at Harvard University, advised by <a href="https://lsn235711.github.io/" target="_blank">Shuangning Li</a> and <a href="http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~samurphy/" target="_blank">Susan Murphy</a>, and working on a reinforcement learning algorithm for mobile health trials.

This past summer I worked as a undergraduate research assistant at the University of Manchester under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/robertedwardgauntmanchester/" target="_blank">Robert Gaunt</a>, researching the properties of the generalized hyperbolic (GH) distribution. In industry, I've interned at Mako, working in quantitative finance, and at Marlex, working in machine learning engineering. 

I volunteer as a data scientist at <a href="https://gironaest.cat/" target="_blank">Fundaci√≥ Girona Est</a>. I'm from Barcelona, where I graduated from the Spanish Baccalaureate in 2020.
