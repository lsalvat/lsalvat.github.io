I'm a Mathematics and Physics student at The University of Manchester, focusing on Probability & Statistics and Theoretical Quantum Mechanics. I'm also a Research Assistant at Harvard University, working in the <a href="http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~samurphy/lab/overview.html" target="_blank">Statistical Reinforcement Learning Laboratory</a> and supervised by <a href="https://lsn235711.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Shuangning Li</a> & <a href="http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~samurphy/" target="_blank">Prof. Susan Murphy</a>.

This past summer I worked as a Research Assistant at The University of Manchester under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/robertedwardgauntmanchester/" target="_blank">Dr. Robert Gaunt</a>, researching the generalized hyperbolic (GH) distribution. In the past, I have completed internships in Data Science and Machine Learning, and have been invited to insight events at Jane Street and Citadel. I'm from Barcelona, where I graduated from the Spanish Baccalaureate in 2020.
